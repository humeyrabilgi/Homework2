  <font class="b" face="Times New Roman"  size="4" ><b>PYGELA</b><br></br>This antique city was established on the hill where today’s Club Pigale and 
  Disco and A'la Carte Restaurant of the Kuştur Holiday Clubs are located.Pygela is the world’s very first health city. The King of Argos, Agamemnon, 
  founded the Pigale in Kuşadası and Agamemnon City in İzmir specifically “to rest his soldiers and to fix his armada” during the Trojan Wars which lasted 
  for almost ten tyears.Both cities succeeded in improving the soldiers’ mental and physical health which had deteriorated during war with the help of the 
  healing spring waters available in their proximity.The Çam Port, where Pine Bay Holiday Club is today, and the pond-swamp behind where Tusan Hotel is located
  presently were used as a port and the shipyard ofPigale City respectively. At a later date the Pigale Health City and Port became the resting and entertainment 
  place for the soldiers of Alexander the Great  who came to Ephesus.</font>

  <font class="b"  face="Times New Roman"  size="4" ><b>ANAIA - ANEA (SOĞUCAK) – KADI FORTRESS<br></br></b>This coastal town in the Carta area right across the Samos Island
  was an e commercial centre as well as shelter for pirate ships owing to its convenient structure. During the Anaia Athens-Spartan Wars (B.C. 431-404), this area was occupied
  by the banished and fugitive people from Samos who supported Athens and who were enemies to them. The people here were supporting Spartans against Samos rulers and the Athenians.
  The name of this city is associated and known for the events which took place in Thukydides during the era. By 1304, Anea (Kadıkalesi), and the nearby Necropolis not only hosted
  a Genoese colony but was under Byzantium Ruling also. The Genoese and the native Greeks living in Anea City was also known to have organised pirate attacks against Venetian
  commercial ships shortly after the Kemalpaşa (Nif) convention. Ania was included in the Turkish territory after Ephesus and İzmir in 1317.</font>

  <font class="b" face="Times New Roman"  size="4"><b><br></br>GÜVERCİNADA</b><br></br>This is a small island located on the Kuşadası Coast and is connected to the mainland via
  a breakwater. The island hosts a fortress built in the Byzantium period. The island performed an outpost task during Ottoman Empire times and especially against attacks
  expected from Greek Islands during the Mora revolt. Furthermore, since the island was utilized in efforts against pirates, it is also referred as the “Pirate Castle” by
  community. The fortress was renovated, illuminated and put in service for tourism purposes.</font>
